# Atomic SDK: Examples

Welcome to the examples directory! Each script here is a runnable, real-world demonstration of how to use the `atomic-sdk` to interact with a specific part of the WP.cloud Atomic API.

The scripts are numbered to suggest a logical order for learning the API, starting from basic checks and moving to more complex operations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Before running any examples, you must set up your environment.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have installed the SDK in editable mode with the `[dev]` dependencies, which includes `python-dotenv`. From the project root:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 2. Create Your `.env` File
This project uses a `.env` file to securely manage your API credentials.
1.  Copy the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
2.  Edit the new `.env` file and add your credentials:
    ```
    # Your main Atomic API Key
    ATOMIC_API_KEY="key_goes_here"
    
    # Your client identifier string (e.g., "myhostingco")
    ATOMIC_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id_goes_here"

    # The domain name you will use for testing the site examples
    SITE_DOMAIN="sdk-test.yourdomain.com"
    ```
All example scripts will automatically load these variables.

## 📖 A Step-by-Step User Story

Here is a recommended workflow for using the SDK, following the numbered example scripts.

## ✅ Step 0: Test Your Connection
*   **Goal:** Confirm your API key is valid and you can reach the platform.
*   **Run:** `python examples/utility/01_test_api_connectivity.py`
*   **Shows:**
    *   How to initialize the `AtomicClient`.
    *   Using the `client.utility.test_status()` endpoint for a basic success (200 OK) check.

## 🔧 Step 1: Configure Client Settings

*   **Run:** `python examples/client/01_manage_client_meta.py`
*   **Shows:**
    *   Getting a client-level metadata value using `client.client.get_meta()`.
    *   Handling the expected `NotFoundError` if the key has never been set.
    *   Setting up webhook via `client.client.set_meta()` .
    *   Verifying the change and optional prompt for cleaning it up via `client.client.remove_meta()`.

## 🛫 Step 2: Perform Pre-Flight Checks for a New Site
*   **Goal:** Before creating a site, ensure the domain is available and find out which IPs to point your DNS to.
*   **Run:** `python examples/sites/00_check_can_host_domain.py`
*   **Shows:**
    *   Checking if a domain is already in use on the platform with `client.sites.check_can_host_domain()`.
    *   Retrieving the target IP addresses for your DNS A records using `client.sites.get_ips()`.
    *   Comparing the required IPs with the domain's current DNS records.

## 🖥️🌐 Step 3: Create and Verify Your First Site
*   **Goal:** Provision a new site for testing and confirm its settings were applied correctly.
*   **Run:** `python examples/sites/01_create_and_get_site.py`
*   **Shows:**
    *   Checking if a site already exists with `client.sites.get()` to prevent errors.
    *   Creating a new site with `client.sites.create()`, specifying parameters like `php_version`, `space_quota`, and custom `meta` data.
    *   Using a helper function to poll the returned `Job` object until the creation is successful.
    *   Retrieving the full site details with `client.sites.get(extra=True)` and verifying all settings.

## ⚙️ Step 4: Manage Your New Site
Once your site exists, you can perform various management tasks.

### 💿 Manage Software
*   **Run:** `python examples/sites/02_manage_software.py`
